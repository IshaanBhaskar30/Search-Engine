🔎 LangChain Web Search Agent Demo (Arxiv, Wikipedia, DuckDuckGo)

This Streamlit app showcases an intelligent web-searching chatbot built using LangChain’s agent architecture and Groq's LLaMA3 model. The agent can autonomously gather real-time information by interacting with tools like Wikipedia, Arxiv, and DuckDuckGo Search. It interprets user questions, selects the appropriate data source, and returns concise, relevant answers—all while streaming its thought process in the UI.

Key features:

->🌐 Multi-source tool integration: DuckDuckGo, Arxiv, and Wikipedia

->🤖 LangChain ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION agent with reasoning steps

->🧠 Groq’s LLaMA3-8b-8192 model for fast, intelligent responses

->🔄 StreamlitCallbackHandler for real-time agent action display

->💬 Interactive chat interface with message history and streaming

Ideal for demos of tool-augmented agents, AI research assistants, or educational use cases involving real-time web search and summarization with large language models.
